# Software Development 1 
# Lab 1 -- Introduction to Jupyter

## The contents of this lab will be carried out on a Jupiter Notebook. Information on using Jupiter notebooks can be found at: https://jupyter.org/

To create our Jupyter notebooks we will use Anaconda: a free and open-source distribution of the Python. Roehampton's computers should have this installed. You can download a copy for your personal computer at:
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

If installing, follow the prompts from the installer. Once installed, head to the "Anaconda Navigator" shortcut. 
In the Anaconda Navigator, we will have access to Jupyter Notebooks. As you launch the application, a new window in your browser will open. This is your Jupyter Notebook. Once opened, make sure to save it somewhere you can easily access. Roehampton University provides you with a Microsoft One Drive folder. Create a folder for this class (Software Development 1) and save the Jupyter Notebook as "Lecture_1.ipynb". Each .ipynb file is one notebook, so each time you create a new notebook, a new .ipynb file will be created.

Jupyter Notebooks are an interactive computing environment for Python. Jupyter is an acronym for the programming languages Julia, Python and R. A Jupyter notebook integrates code and its output into a single document that combines visualizations, narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media. Jupyter Notebooks are now a major part of the data science workflow. 

In this lab, we’ll explore 
1.  What is Programming (Video/ Exercises)
2.  Programming Languages (Video/ Exercises)
3.  Introduction to Python (Video/ Exercises)

By the end of this lab and its accompanying seminar, you’ll be able to run Python code via Jupyter Notebooks. You’ll have knowledge of programming concepts, programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Our goal is to make you think as a computer scientist so that when you are faced with a challenge, you’ll immediately think:

> "How am I going to write a piece of code to help me tackle this?"

A few tips: Practice, practice, practice. You can’t passively absorb programming as a skill. Please view the videos before lecture so that you can maximise our time together. Remember that your instructor is not a mind reader, please tell them when you are struggling. Finally, don’t be afraid to try your code, you won’t break your computer!

Let’s get started.
### Exercise
    # Our first Python program, print out "Hello, world"
    
    print("Hello, world")

fun fact: Brian Kernighan wrote the first "hello, world" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards. BCPL was used while C was being developed at Bell Labs a few years before the publication of Kernighan and Ritchie's C book in 1972.
