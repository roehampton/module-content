## Assessment Task

The coursework consists of two elements:

1. The design of algorithms using flowcharts and pseudocode.
2. The implementation of your design using Google's Blockly.

## Purpose of the Assessment

- To demonstrate that the learning outcomes have been met
- To demonstrate the application of academic skills to computer science topics
- To demonstrate computational thinking skills by designing an algorithm
- To become familiar with programming by implementing algorithm designs in a Visual Programming Language.

## Learning Outcomes Addressed by this Assignment

- Design a simple algorithm to solve a problem using flowcharts and pseudocode.
- Construct a program to solve a problem using a Visual Programming Language.

### Learning Outcomes Addressed by the Assignment

- Design a simple algorithm to solve a problem using flowcharts and pseudocode.

### Assessment Task

In this assessment you will create the flowchart and pseudocode for the following three problems.

1. A program that asks the user to enter two numbers. It then tells the user which one is the greatest, which one is the smallest, or if they are both equal states they are both equal.

2. A program that loops, reading numbers from the user and reports whether each value is positive or negative (greater than or less than 0). The loop terminates when the user enters 0 (no message is displayed in this case).

3. A program that loops through the numbers from 1 to 100. For each number it prints the following:

   - If the number is divisible by 3, Fizz.
   - If the number is divisible by 5, Buzz.
   - If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, FizzBuzz.
   - If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, then the number should be printed.

   For example:

   - 1
   - 2
   - Fizz
   - 4
   - Buzz

### Submission

You are to submit the following for each of the three problems:

1. Flowchart
2. Pseudocode

These will be uploaded as a single PDF to Moodle by **4 pm on 18th of March.**

### Marking Scheme

The following rubric will be used to assess your submission.

| **Criteria**                                                 | **Excellent**                                                | **Good**                                                     | **Developing**                                               | **Not attempted**                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Solution** the completeness of the solution to meet the specification given. | A completed solution meeting all the specifications.         | A completed solution that does not quite meet all the specifications. | A completed solution is implemented but lacks much of the specification. | Solution does not meet the specification defined.            |
| **Design** ability to decompose a problem into coherent and reusable parts. | The design uses appropriate structures. The overall design is appropriate. | The design generally uses appropriate structures.            | Not all of the selected structures are appropriate. Some of the design elements are appropriately used. | Few if any of the selected structures are appropriate, or the solution is decomposed in ways that make little sense. |
| **Correctness** ability to create pseudocode and flowcharts that reliably produces correct answers. | Pseudocode and flowcharts produce correct answers for all inputs. | Pseudocode and flowcharts produce correct answers of appropriate results for most inputs. | Pseudocode and flowcharts produce appropriate results for most inputs but can contain miscalculations. | Pseudocode and flowcharts do not produce correct answers for most inputs. |
| **Logic** ability to use correct  structures appropriate to the problem domain. | Logic is correct with no obvious error, no redundancy or contradictory conditions. | Logic is mostly correct but may contain occasional errors, redundancy, or contradictory conditions. | Logic is on the right track but shows no recognition of obvious errors. | Logic contains some conditions that specify the opposite of what is required, and may lead to infinite loops. |
| **Clarity** ability to provide a clear solution to the problem for human consumption. | Solution is clearly defined and documented. Formatting and other considerations aid readability. | Solution is generally understandable and has some supporting documentation. Formatting isn't perfect but doesn't cause confusion. | Solution is somewhat understandable and has at least  some further clarity points. Formatting sometimes leads to confusion of what was designed. | Solution is not understandable, lacks clarifying documentation, and formatting is inappropriate. |

### Learning Outcome Addressed by this Assignment

- Construct a program to solve a problem using a Visual Programming Language.

### Assessment Task

In this assessment you will build your programs using Google's Blockly. You will implement the program for each problem, using Python as the output language.

### Submission

You have to submit the following for each of the three problems:

1. Screenshot of your solution in Google Blockly.
2. Python code produced by your Blocky solution.
