# Software Engineering Lecture 01 -- Version Control

## What is Version Control

Version control is about the management of changes to documents or collections of information.  Although you might think of version control as an inherently software development tool, it can be used for anything really.  From a software development perspective, version control is a component of **Software Configuration Management (SCM)**.  Git's main website has the address [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) as it is a part of SCM.

Version control is embedded in a number of tools.  For example, Google Docs automatically versions your document as you make edits:

![Google Doc Versioning](google-doc-version.png)

Track changes and similar functionality exists in Microsoft Word.  The key point is that version management is seen as a key feature of documents in general, not just software.  It allows two key pieces of meta-data to be tracked:

1. **When** a change was made.
2. **Who** made the change.

Both pieces of information allow us to track back to where problems arose, and know where to fix the issue.  When working in a team this information can be fundamental to ensure everyone is working on the same version of the document, or at least know which changes have been made between different working versions.

Another key idea in version control is that we can return to previous versions of our document.  Therefore, if we make an error (e.g. add a bug) we can **rewind** to the previous version - or any previous version - and continue our work from there:

![Version Control Rewind](rewind.png)

A further idea is the concept of working and managing multiple versions of the document using a concept called **branching**.  Different branches allow different versions of the information to be worked on discretely by several people.  When work needs to be combined we can **merge** the information together into one of the branches:

### Popular Version Control Tools

There are many version control tools available to the software engineer.  A few of the more popular ones are:

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) which is commonly associated with popular repository sites such as [**GitHub**](https://github.com/), [**GitLab**](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [**Bitbucket**](https://bitbucket.org/).  Git is independent of these platforms and should not be confused with them.
- [**Mercurial**](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) is a popular alternative to Git, and developed as a replacement for *BitKeeper* which itself led to the development of Git.  The history of why BitKeeper is not popular and led to both Git and Mercurial is [interesting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper).  Mercurial, although less well known, is used by big organisations such as Facebook and Mozilla.
- [**Subversion (SVN)**](https://subversion.apache.org/) which is an *Apache* project that derived from an older tool called *Concurrent Versions System (CVS)*.

### Version Control Approaches

There are three approaches a Version Control System (VCS) can take:

- **Localised**, which means developers must be working on the same file-system.  These were early approaches and no longer relevant today.
- **Client-server** where multiple developers (*clients*) can work locally and push changes to a single server repository.
- **Distributed** where the complete code-base and history is stored by each developer locally, thus replicating the repository.  Developers can collaborate via remote repositories - such as on GitHub.

*Git is a distributed approach.*

### Some Terminology

Before looking at the history of version control let us define some common terms in a VCS:

- **Repository** is where the code and history is stored.  In a *client-server* model this is on the server.  In a *distributed* model this is any local version.
- **Checkout** or **clone** is the process of getting a copy of the code from the repository.  In a *client-server* model, we *checkout* the code.  In a *distributed* model, we *clone* the entire repository, including the history.
- **Working copy** is the local version of the code-base.  We can make any changes we want to the working copy as it is not reflected anywhere else - it is a sandbox.
- **Fetch** or **pull** is to get the most recent version of the code-base from the remote repository.  In *Git*, *fetch* and *pull* are different in that pull will also merge any changes into the local working copy.
- **Push** is when we push our local changes to the remote repository.  To do this we have to create a commit.
- **Commit** is a new version of the code-base.  Typically a commit contains the changes added in the local *working copy* which can then be sent to the remote repository if need be.  In *distributed* models, working copies are repositories, so we can undertake numerous commits before pushing all the changes to the remote repository.
- **Tag** or **label** is extra information we can add to a particular commit, such as `v0.1.0`.
- **Head** is a special *tag* or *label* for the most recent *commit* on a *branch*.
- **Branch** is another version of the code-base.  Branches are independent, meaning they can be worked on without causing conflicts.  We *merge* branches when we wish to synchronise them.
- **Main** or **trunk** is the name of the main *branch* in a repository.  Git uses the term *main* and SVN uses the term *trunk*.
- **Merge** is the process of combining one *branch* into another.  Any differences between files in the branches have to be resolved before the merge can be completed.
- **Conflict** occurs when different change versions of the same document exist while merging branches which must be fixed.
- **Resolve** is the process of fixing *conflicts*.  There are tools that can support this process, but it does require human intervention.

## What is Git?

Git is a **distributed VCS** where developers clone a complete copy of the repository, including its history, within the local file system.  Born from the *BitKeeper Controversy*, Linus Torvalds wanted a system that was fast.  He used three points to drive the design of Git:

1. See Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as the model of what **not** to do.
2. Support a distributed workflow, as in BitKeeper.
3. Have strong safeguards against corruption.

So, Git has the following properties:

1. It is fast.
2. It has data integrity features.
3. It is distributed, thus supporting non-linear workflows.

Git is likely the most popular and well known VCS at the moment, although this is partly due to the popularity of GitHub.  The two are often confused, but there is no link between the two beyond GitHub supporting Git repositories.

Let us move onto the principles of Git, which will provide a deeper understanding of how Git works.

## Principles of Git

The following section will step through numerous principles in Git with the relevant commands.  We will look at the basics of repositories, basic workflow for submitting changes, the basic workflow for fetching and merging changes, and the basics of branching.

### Working with Repositories

Git works with *repositories*.  A repository is the code and history of a code-base.  Every time you work with Git you are working within a repository: your local repository.  You may also work with some remote repositories.  That is a key idea with Git - your local machine working copy is also a repository.

You can create your local repository in one of two ways:

1. Initialise an empty repository using `git init` in a folder.
2. Call `git clone <url>` to clone an existing repository from a remote repository as shown below:

![Git Clone](git-clone.png)

When you *clone* a repository you also set up a link to the remote repository called `origin`.  We will discuss [remotes later](#Remotes).

There is a special version of empty initialisation: `git init --bare`.  This is usually used on a server that is used to coordinate teams.  In general, you should *not* use `git init --bare`.

### Working with Changes

A Git repository is a folder which contains a hidden folder (`.git`).  The hidden folder contains the history and other status information of the repository.  Otherwise, the repository just looks like a folder - there is nothing extra managed.

Whenever you add, remove or edit a file in the repository, Git can tell based on the information in the hidden `.git` folder.  Any changes at this point are not saved by Git.  To save the changes, we have to go through two steps:

1. **Add** the changes we want to save at this point.
2. **Commit** the changes to the repository.
3. (optional) **Push** the changes to the remote(s).

#### Adding Changes

Before step 1 (adding changes) we are in a working files state.  We are editing files and working on our code but not ready to store the changes long term.  This is usually because we are not finished whatever change we have in mind.

Once we are ready to add the changes we can use the following command:

```shell
git add <filename>
```

We can name each file individually, name a folder, or use a wildcard (e.g., `git add *`).  In any case, we have moved changes from the working area to the **staging area**.

We can see files that are different from the currently Git version or staged using the following command:

```shell
git status
```

`git status` is useful for keeping track of the work we are doing.  You should use it often to remind yourself what you are doing.

Once we have added all the changes we want for a particular feature/task, we create a **commit**.

#### Committing Changes

A **commit** is just a group of changes.  A commit operation takes the changes currently in the staging area and creates a new **snapshot** of our code at this point.  Git stores this snapshot in its history.  To create a commit, we use the following:

```shell
git commit -m "<message>"
```

The `message` should be informative about what the changes are.  A `message` should ideally be simple and to the point (e.g., do not use the word *and* if you can avoid it).  The messages allow others to see the changes made and (hopefully) why, thus providing more information to your fellow software developers.

A commit is a store piece of history, and Git keeps track of all the history in a repository.  This actually has an advantage - *you can ask Git to go back to a previous version*.  In simple terms, Git provides you with a big rewind button that allows you to go back to previous versions of your code, so as advice:

- Create commits often, from simple little changes that don't break the build.
- Experiment in the comfort that you can always go back to a previous working version of your application.

The big idea is to **commit often**.  Commits allow you to **checkout** a previous commit if anything goes wrong.  *But always ensure your commit works!*

#### Pushing Changes

Any commit created on your machine is only stored locally.  So, although you have been keeping a good record of your changes locally, they can not be seen by others.  Your changes have also not been stored on a remote server.  To do this, we use the `git push` command:

```shell
git push
```

`git push` will push the current branch (e.g., `master`) to the current remote (normally `origin`).  You can be more explicit with a push:

```shell
git push <remote> <branch>
```

For example, it is common to see `git push origin master`.  This will push your local version of branch `master` to the `origin` remote.

There are other options with `git push` such as:

- `git push --force` forces your local branch version to become the remote's.  **Not recommended!**
- `git push --all` pushes updates to all local branches to the remote.  Useful shortcut if needed.

#### Diffs

Git keeps track of history by storing the *differences* between files.  We can simplify a difference to four types:

1. The addition of a new file and its initial contents.
2. The removal of a file.
3. The addition of new lines to a file.
4. The removal of lines from a file.

If you edit a line it is considered a new line addition and the old line being removed.  To see the changes made, we can use the `git diff` command:

![Git Difference Between Two Files](diff.png)

As Git tracks changes as line additions and removals, it is very good at monitoring text files (such as code files).  It is very bad at binary data such as executables and images.  A couple of rules:

- **Do not store executables in your Git repository** - even those built by the project.
- **Be careful when working with media files** - only store versions that will not change.

The `.git` folder contains all the changes, and so a repository can become large if you do not behave yourself.  If your repository becomes many megabytes in size you are probably tracking something you should not be.

#### Git Log

Once we have some commits, we can ask Git to provide us with the history of commits in the **Git Log**.  To open the log use the `log` command:

```shell
git log
```

`log` opens the Git log file, for example:

```shell
commit e426d2c1b1aa7f732c5b863708de4e3a29da3b52 (HEAD -> feature/lecture03, origin/feature/lecture03)
Author: Kevin Chalmers <k.chalmers@napier.ac.uk>

    Almost completed section on adding changes to lecture 03.

    Added working with repositories section.

    Spell check.

commit dcbc34b2d990f768317c7e7a684b1de037ac199c
Author: Kevin Chalmers <k.chalmers@napier.ac.uk>
Date:   Thu Aug 9 14:31:58 2018 +0100
```

The hex value is the [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) hash of the commit which Git generates automatically for every commit you make. The SHA-1 hash is after the word **commit**.

A better way to use `log` is to display simple information.  For example, we can provide the information on one line

```shell
git log --pretty=oneline
```

Which provides the following:

```shell
e426d2c1b1aa7f732c5b863708de4e3a29da3b52 (HEAD -> feature/lecture03, origin/feature/lecture03) Almost completed section on adding changes to lecture 03.

9dbd514068d6af135b55e8e7e49181c38e831b19 Fix to image file.
```

The SHA-1 hash can be shortened to a more usable version as follows:

```shell
git log --pretty="%h %s"
```

The `%h` will provide the short SHA-1 hash, and `%s` the commit message:

```shell
e426d2c Almost completed section on adding changes to lecture 03.
b534798 Added working with repositories section.
b9001d5 Spell check.
dcbc34b Added intro to git.
bc03649 Fix to image file.
9dbd514 Fix to image file.
```

#### Going Backwards

Once you have a chain of commits it is possible to go backwards through our work.  There are various methods to return to previous states of the repository - some of which can be destructive.  We will look at the basic approach which is non-destructive.

Git provides a command - `checkout` - that allows you to revert to a previous commit.  It has the following form:

```shell
git checkout <hash>
```

The `<hash>` value is the SHA-1 hash from the log.  You can use the shortened hash:

```shell
git checkout b9001d5
```

Checking out previous commits allows you to revert to a previous repository state which may fix errors with your work.  The ability to go backwards is one of the key features of version control.

### Fetching and Merging Changes

When multiple people are working on a single code-base we often want to take their changes and merge them into our own.  There are essentially two methods to do this:

#### Fetch and Merge

We can fetch the current version of the remote repository using the `fetch` command:

```shell
git fetch <remote>
```

`<remote>` is the name of the remote repository you want to fetch from - in the initial case this will likely be `origin`:

```shell
git fetch origin
```

We can also fetch from different branches or from everything.

A `fetch` operation does not do anything to change the files you are working with.  `fetch` simply gets the remote history.  To see any changes you have to `merge`:

```shell
git merge <branch>
```

To start with you will likely use `origin/master` to merge the `master` branch from the `origin` remote:

```shell
git merge origin/master
```

You will now be able to see any changes made to the remote repository in your local files.

Merging with `merge` is also how you combine changes from one branch into another.  For example, say you are working on a `feature` branch and want to merge the changes there into the main `master` branch.  To do so we must perform the following steps:

1. Commit any changes to the `feature` branch.
2. Checkout the `master` branch.
3. Merge the `feature` branch into the `master` branch.

The commands for 2. and 3. are:

```shell
git checkout master
git merge feature
```

We will look at branching presently.

#### Pulling

Fetching and merging provide a fine-grained control over managing changes, but often you just want to get the most recent updates without any worry.  To do this, we use the `pull` command:

```shell
git pull
```

And that is it.  `pull` will perform the fetching and merging (if it can) for you.  Generally, as a beginner you will find `pull` provides the functionality you need.

#### Managing Conflicts

Problems arise when you have changed a file that has also been changed by someone else.  Managing conflicts can be a tricky business, and rather than try to explain it here we will provide a [reference](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/) for you to read.

### Branching

A powerful technique of version control is the ability to create different *branches*.  A **branch** is a new *version* of the code that is independent to other branches, including the main one.  For example:

![Git Branches](branches.PNG)

Here, four branches are in operation.  The one on the left will be `master`.  From this two further branches were made, and from one of these a further branch, leading to four.  Each have their own commits and therefore history.

To create a branch we use the following command:

```shell
git branch <name>
```

This will create a new branch with the given name from the current state of the repository.  We then need to switch to that branch:

```shell
git checkout <name>
```

This will switch to (`checkout`) the new branch, and allow you to work in a new unique instance of the codebase.  You can do both operations at once:

```shell
git checkout -b <name>
```

The `-b` flag also creates a branch while switching.

Once you have a new branch and do some work on it, we will want to **merge** these changes back into single branch - this is the collaborative nature of version control.  To combine branches we do the following:

```shell
git merge <name>
```

This will merge the named branch into the current branch.  We can now define a typical branching workflow:

1. Create a new branch and check it out - `git checkout -b my_branch`.
2. Do some work.
3. Add necessary changes to the commit - `git add *` for example.
4. Commit the changes - `git commit -m "Did some changes"`.
5. Checkout the original branch - `git checkout master` for example.
6. Perform the merge - `git merge my_branch`.
7. Commit the new changes to the original branch - `git commit -m "Merged with my_branch"`.
8. Push the changes to the main remote - `git push`.

Steps 2-4 are repeated until you are ready to do the final merge - **do not merge every small change**.  The point is that changes are isolated and kept to the branch they are being undertaken in.

### Remotes

A final command we will look at is `git remote`.  This allows us to view or add remotes.  A remote is just a remote repository - such as a GitHub one.  Remote repositories are used for collaboration.  To view the current remote we use the raw command:

```shell
git remote
```

Which will display the name of the current remote, e.g.,:

```shell
origin
```

We can also list all current remotes:

```shell
git remote -v
```

For example:

```shell
origin  https://github.com/kevin-chalmers/set08103.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/kevin-chalmers/set08103.git (push)
```

And to add a new remote we use the following command:

```shell
git remote add <name> <url>
```

This will add a new remote with the given name using the given URL.  We can now push and pull from this remote using the given name.

### Ignoring Files

A final piece of functionality is ignoring files.  It is often the case that the build system and other functions will generate files we do not want to store in our repository.  Binary files are such an example.

To ignore files, we specify a `.gitignore` file.  This file uses wildcards, folder names, etc. to specify files to ignore.

### A Simple Git Workflow

1. Modify files to make a working change.
2. Add changes to the staging area with `git add`.
3. Create a commit from the changes with `git commit`.
4. Send the changes to the remote with `git push`.

### Summary
