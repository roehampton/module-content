# Software engineering - seminar 1



## Setting up github project


You can use github to manage your project as well as your code.

For the seminar today, you'll practice setting up a basic project, adding collaborators and adding tickets that are assigned to developers.


### Creating a project

   1. Sign in to github
   2. Go to the repository you created for your lab work
   3. Click 'projects' from the top navigation
   4. Click the green 'new project' button
   5. Choose 'kanban' from the featured templates shown
   

This will take you immediately to an empty kanban board with columns already defined.


### Create your first issues

   1. At the bottom of the 'todo' column, click 'add item' and type in the name of the issue you want to add for example 'code of conduct'
   2. This will be added to the todo column.  Depending on your initial settings, it may be added as a 'draft'.
   3. If the item has been added as a draft, click the three dots next to the 'draft' icon and text.  Choose 'convert to issue.'.  For the item to be published, you will need to link it to the repo, use the one you created for the lab.
   4. Now the icon should turn green and be given an issue number.
   5. Repeat this process so you have at least three issues added to your taskboard.
   

### Add team members

   1. To assign team members to issues, you need to make them collaborators in your project.  To do this, go to the three dots in the right corner, just under your prfile icon.  These are the settings for the project.  click on the dots and choose 'settings'.
   2. click 'manage access' in the left hand column
   3. Invite your collborators


### Assign issues to team members

   1. Go back to your Kanban board.
   2. Click into one of the tickets by clicking on its title
   3. Take a look at the options in the right hand side
   3. Assign a team member
   4. Go back to  your kanban board and take a look.
   5. Click into the 'team items' and 'my items' tabs and observe how they can help you organise your project.
   

### Assign priorities to items

   1. Click into one of the tickets by clicking on its title
   3. Take a look at the options in the right hand side
   3. In the 'projects' box, choose a priority
   4. Go back to  your kanban board and take a look.
   5. Click into the 'priority tabs and observe how they can help you organise your project.
   

### More things to try

   1. Customise priorities through the project settings
   2. Add start and end dates to tickets and explore the 'Roadmap' view
   3. Add start organising tickets into 'iterations'
