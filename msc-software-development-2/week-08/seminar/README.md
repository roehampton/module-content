# Software Development 2 Seminar 08 

To prepare for Sprint 3 you must do the following:

1. Have a database design that supports your goals
2. Have created this database and pre-populated it with values via PhpMyadmin.
3. Have a shared repository set up with the scaffolding files (we will do this in class)
4. Have wireframes ready for the features you will create for Sprint 3
5. Be ready to write the code!  We will be expecting to see you able to show information held in your database in the frontend.  Nothing needs to look great at this point!

Consider splitting up tasks: 
* Your frontend developer can start creating templates in pug using placeholder values. 
*  Your backend developer can start setting up routes in app.js and the framework for querying the database. 
*  Your DBM can start to design the database, create tables and pre-fill values.

Do you have enought/adequate design documentation to proceed with these tasks separately? If you do not - think about what will still help you.

## How to set up the Github shared repository

__ONE__ person in your group should:​

  * Create a fresh directory on their own computer​
  * Clone your existing project repository into that fresh directory​
  * Download the scaffolding files, unzip them and copy them ALL into the fresh directory (https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Yrr6Zx1di9wFF5z5i87clU4bOL_HIPN/view ) find the link in week 6 moodle​
  * Run:
    
```git status```    

( this should show all the newly added files)​

```git add . ```  

(will add all the files)​

```git commit –m "adding scaffolding   files"​```

(will commit)

```git push​```

(will make the files available to all the team)

__NOW​__

  * All your team members should be able to clone (or pull)​

  * Make sure all team members are added to your repo and can push as well as pull​

__NOTE__ that each developer will need to add a .env file as this is excluded from the repository
