# Coursework Assessment Details

## Coursework Specification

You will work on the project as a Scrum team. Details on Scrum are provided in the first set of seminar notes, including an FAQ on how to apply Scrum in the module.

The coursework is worth 100% of the total module mark. Delivery of the coursework is divided into four three-week Sprints. You will also be evaluated for your individual contribution to the project. The marks for the coursework are divided as follows:

| **Title**             | **Deadline**      | **Marks** |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Sprint 1              | 17 October           | 15%       |
| Sprint 2              | 3 November           | 15%       |
| Sprint 3              | 2 December           | 25%       |
| Sprint 4              | 12 January | 25%       |
| Individual Reflection | 14 January | 20%       |

In this coursework you are tasked with creating a dynamic web application for the smooth and efficient operation of a business of your team's choosing. Hence you are required to specify what type of business you will be building your application for. 

**Your application must be built using the tools and techniques taught in the module, although there is some flexibility.**

- Your web front-end should use PUG. If your team wants to use a different front-end web framework then you must seek permission from the teaching team first.
- Your web back-end must run via Node.js. This is not negotiable.
- Your front-end and back-end must communicate via Express.js. 
- Your application must use a database for storage. We will teach you SQLite and MySQL, but you can use other database systems such as a NoSQL system such as MongoDB. You must discuss this choice with the teaching team first.
- Your application must be version controlled using Git and publicly accessible on GitHub. This is not negotiable.
- Your application must be deployable as a Docker container. 

### Advice on Application Choice

We are not looking for anything sophisticated in your application. Fundamentally, you should aim to develop a [CRUD application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete). A CRUD application is effectively a front-end to a database, providing a method to create, read, update, and delete data from a web site to a database on a server.

## Group Submission

The coursework **must** be delivered by a group. The aim of the module is to assess your ability to work as a team to deliver a product. Therefore, the majority of your coursework grade will be based on your team's ability to work together using the methods defined in the module.

The submission is monitored weekly during lab stand-up meetings, and formally via the Sprint assessment points. Your final submission is delivered via your GitHub repository.

## Individual Assessment

Individual contributions to the team will be assessed based on attendance at the various meetings and via metrics gathered from tools such as GitHub. **Lack of individual contributions can lead to a scaling of the overall coursework grade if the module team have evidence that illustrates a lack of contribution to the team deliverable.**

The coursework **must** be delivered as part of a team. **If anyone is dismissed from their team this means they cannot deliver the coursework and will fail.** Dismissal from a team uses the following process:

- An individual is evidenced as breaching the Code of Conduct as set-out by the team.
- Evidence is presented at the next available meeting with a member of the module delivery team.
- The individual evidenced will have the opportunity to evidence mitigating circumstances either to the student team or privately to a member of the module delivery team.
- The module delivery team retains the right to make a final decision on whether the dismissal is warranted.

Any dismissed team member has a week to appeal the decision to the module team with suitable evidence provided.

## Sprint Deliverables

Each group will undertake **four** graded Sprints:

dates tbc



Each Sprint features a submission (via Moodle) and a review at the next class session. Each group will be given **10 minutes maximum** for the review. Your group will be **allocated a time for the code review.** The details of the individual review points are below. These meetings **must be attended** at the **stated time.** Guidelines for review attendance:

- **Being late** for the meeting or **not being ready** when the meeting starts will result in the grade for the review being capped at 50%.
- **Not attending** the meeting will mean the review will be marked at 0%.

**All team members** should attend the review, however commitments and other considerations will be taken into account. **Individual attendance at reviews will be monitored** to ensure the team is contributing collectively to the project.

**Being ready** means that you are ready to present the points for the review. This means that you have a computer with the various tools logged in (e.g., GitHub) and a working version of the application in Visual Studio Code.

### Sprint 1

#### Submission: 17 October

#### Review Meeting: 18 October

The aim of this Sprint is to check that the project workflow is set up for the team. You may choose to meet some of the feature requirements during this delivery but point, but it is not a necessity.
