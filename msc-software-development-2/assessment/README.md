# Coursework Assessment Details

## Coursework Specification

You will work on the project as a Scrum team. Details on Scrum are provided in the first set of seminar notes, including an FAQ on how to apply Scrum in the module.

The coursework is worth 100% of the total module mark. Delivery of the coursework is divided into four three-week Sprints. You will also be evaluated for your individual contribution to the project. The marks for the coursework are divided as follows:

| **Title**             | **Deadline**      | **Marks** |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Sprint 1              | tbc         | 15%       |
| Sprint 2              | tbc           | 15%       |
| Sprint 3              | tbc           | 25%       |
| Sprint 4              | tbc | 25%       |
| Individual Reflection | tbc | 20%       |

In this coursework you are tasked with creating a dynamic web application for the smooth and efficient operation of a business of your team's choosing. Hence you are required to specify what type of business you will be building your application for. 

**Your application must be built using the tools and techniques taught in the module.  This ensures that all team members can contribute equally**

- Your web front-end should use PUG. 
- Your web back-end must run via Node.js. 
- Your front-end and back-end must communicate via Express.js. 
- Your application must use a MYSQL database for storage. 
- Your application must be version controlled using Git. 
- Your application must be deployable using Docker. 

### Advice on Application Choice

We are not looking for anything sophisticated in your application. Fundamentally, you should aim to develop a [CRUD application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete). A CRUD application is effectively a front-end to a database, providing a method to create, read, update, and delete data from a web site to a database on a server.

## Group Submission

The coursework **must** be delivered by a group. The aim of the module is to assess your ability to work as a team to deliver a product. Therefore, the majority of your coursework grade will be based on your team's ability to work together using the methods defined in the module.

The submission is monitored weekly during lab stand-up meetings, and formally via the Sprint assessment points. Your final submission is delivered via your GitHub repository.

## Individual Assessment

Individual contributions to the team will be assessed based on attendance at the various meetings and via metrics gathered from tools such as GitHub. **Lack of individual contributions can lead to a scaling of the overall coursework grade if the module team have evidence that illustrates a lack of contribution to the team deliverable.**

The coursework **must** be delivered as part of a team. **If anyone is dismissed from their team this means they cannot deliver the coursework and will fail.** Dismissal from a team uses the following process:

- An individual is evidenced as breaching the Code of Conduct as set-out by the team.
- Evidence is presented at the next available meeting with a member of the module delivery team.
- The individual evidenced will have the opportunity to evidence mitigating circumstances either to the student team or privately to a member of the module delivery team.
- The module delivery team retains the right to make a final decision on whether the dismissal is warranted.

Any dismissed team member has a week to appeal the decision to the module team with suitable evidence provided.

## Sprint Deliverables

Each group will undertake **four** graded Sprints:

dates tbc



Each Sprint features a submission (via Moodle) and a review at the next class session. Each group will be given 10 minutes* for the review. The details of the individual review points are below. These meetings **must be attended**. Guidelines for review attendance:

- **Not attending** the meeting will mean the review will be marked at 0%.

**All team members** should attend the review, however commitments and other considerations will be taken into account. **Individual attendance at reviews will be monitored** to ensure the team is contributing collectively to the project.

**Being ready** means that you are ready to present the points for the review. This means that you have a computer with the various tools logged in (e.g., GitHub) and a working version of the application in Visual Studio Code.

### Sprint 1

#### Submission: tbc

#### Review Meeting: tbc

The aim of this Sprint is to check that the project workflow is set up for the team, that you are ready to work together and have an outline of your project objectives.

   * Include a link to your task board.
   * Include a URL for the team's GitHub project.
   * Include your Code of Conduct

### Sprint 2

#### Submission: tbc

#### Review Meeting: tbc

The aim of this Sprint is to check that you have a set of user requirements defined as user stories and that you have designed initial elements of your application.

Submission requirements for this Sprint:

- Full set of user stories defined for your application idea.
- User stories tracked appropriately using your task board
- Suitable diagrams and documentation used to design software, which MUST include:
  - Personas and scenarios
  - Use case diagrams

##### Submission requirements for this Sprint:

- Updated task board of user stories showing progress in the technical deliverables.
- Github repository showing work from all members of the team
- Implementation progress towards final version of application:
  - Database design
  - Database implementation with pre-filled data
  - HTML pages available generated from PUG, showing static content
  - At least some dynamic content being pulled from your database to your templates via Pug - concentrate on views of your data and don't worry about adding/updating for now.

### Sprint 4

#### Submission:tbc

The aim of this Sprint is to deliver the final version of your application. The final version of your application will be pulled automatically from GitHub. The final submission will be assessed based on the following criteria.

- Overall application quality and success at meeting the aims set out during the design process
- Metrics from GitHub: used to assess individual contribution.
- Code quality including the use of OOP and MVC design techniques
- Application deployable using a docker-compose file, data can be provided separately
- Final version of the task board and project requirements met.

2. Design process
   * What design techniques did you use? (for example user stories, wireframes, flow charts, use case diagram)
   * Which ones did you find the most useful for yourself (a) as an individual and (b) for the group
3. Development
   * What did you personally contribute to the project?  
   * How happy were you with your own contribution?
   * Is there anything you would have liked to have done more of?
   * What did you find easy?
