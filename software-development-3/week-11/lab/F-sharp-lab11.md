# Software Development 3
# Lab 11 F#


## 1. Function composition and pipelining

#### Write three functions as follows:

1. square a number
2. double it
3. add 2
4. print the result


#### Use these to


 * Print the result of functions 1, 2 and 3 above using nested functions
 * Create a new composite function to print the result of functions 1, 2, and 3 above
 * Print the result of functions 1, 2 and 3 above using pipelining


Use your print function 4 if possible.

(Note: they should all give the same result)


#### Consider the following

  * Which of the above functions can be considered pure?
  * Which of the solutions do you prefer?
  * When might you choose the composite function over the pipeline and vice versa?
  

## Objects in F#

Create an AnimalBase object in F# and derived classes for Elephant and Snake.  Create some animlas, and print out the name and id for the animals.

#### Begin your coursework

Now consider the objects you created for Sprint 1.  You should have one base class for the bookable items in your project and at least three derived classes.  Implement the base class and at least two derived classes in F#. Instatiate the classes and implement a print function for each derived class (this is the coursework, sprint 4 brief)
