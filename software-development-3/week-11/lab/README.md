# Software Development 3
# Lab 11: Functional programming with Java and Java streams

Start by forking the replit repo at:

## 1. Function composition and pipelining

#### Write two functions as follows:

1. double a number
2. add 5



#### Use these to


 * Print the result of each function separately
 * Create a new composite function of 1 and 2
 * Use pipelining to:
      * run function 1 and then 2
      * run function 2 and then 1

## 2. Using java streams to process collections 

Use java streams instead of loops to process collections

  * Create a list of strings that represent firstnames and surnames separated by a space
  * Create a function that splits the name, returning the firstname only
  * Use a java streams to process each member of the list and print only the firstname
  * Add a Predicate so that only names that begin with A, B or C are printed
