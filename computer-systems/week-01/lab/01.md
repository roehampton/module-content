## Aim

The aim of this lab is to introduce you to the basics of working with a Windows/Unix command line. This is to allow you to navigate the system through commands.


## Terminal Commands Tutorial: Unix & Windows

This tutorial covers basic terminal (command-line) operations on Unix-based systems (e.g., Linux, macOS) and Windows. These commands are essential for navigating file systems and managing files and directories. 

For Unix, most commands work in the default terminal application (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`), while Windows uses `cmd` (Command Prompt) or `Powershell` for similar operations. To enable Unix-like commands on Windows, you can install a Unix shell like Git Bash or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).


> The **computer is dumb.** It does not know when you type `LS` you actually meant `ls`. To the computer, these are different. One of the first skills you have to learn when studying computing is **precision**. The computer has no ability to guess what you mean. It works on exactly interpreting what you enter. This also means you need **patience**. Developing the skills and problem solving ability in computing means taking your time. This takes **practice**.

### 1. Print Working Directory
**Usage**: Prints the current directory you are working in.

- **Unix**:
  `pwd`
- **Windows**:
  `cd`

  In Windows, `cd` alone displays the current directory path.

---

### 2. List Directory Contents
**Usage**: Lists the contents of the current or specified directory.

- **Unix**:
  `ls`

  Optional flags:
  - **`ls -l`**: Displays a detailed listing, showing file permissions, ownership, file size, and modification dates.
     `ls -l`

  - **`ls -a`**: Lists all files, including hidden files (those starting with a dot `.`).
    `ls -a`
  
- **Windows** (use `dir` instead):
   `dir`

  Windows already provides a detailed listing by default, so there's no quivalent to `ls -l`.
 
  Optional flags:
  - **`dir /a`**: Lists all files, including hidden files.

---

### 3. Create a File
**Usage**: Creates an empty file.

- **Unix**:
  `touch filename.txt`
- **Windows**: Use the `echo` command or text editor to create a file.
  `echo. > filename.txt`

---

### 4. Remove a File
**Usage**: Deletes a specified file.

- **Unix**:
  `rm filename.txt`
- **Windows**:
  `del filename.txt`

---

### 5. Create a Directory
**Usage**: Creates a new directory.

- **Unix**:
  `mkdir new_directory`
- **Windows**:
  `mkdir new_directory`

---

### 6. Change Directory
**Usage**: Navigates into a different directory.

- **Unix**:
  `cd /path/to/directory`
- **Windows**:
  `cd C:\path\to\directory`

---

### 7. Move Up One Directory
**Usage**: Moves up one level in the directory structure.

- **Unix**:
  `cd ..`
- **Windows**:
  `cd ..`

---

### 8. Move to Home Directory
**Usage**: Changes to the userâ€™s home directory.

- **Unix**:
  `cd ~`
- **Windows**:
  `cd %USERPROFILE%`

---

### 9. Open a File in Editor
**Usage**: Opens a text file in the `nano` terminal text editor (Unix only).

- **Unix**:
  `nano filename.txt`
- **Windows**: Use `notepad` as the built-in text editor.
  `notepad filename.txt`

---

### 10. Remove a Directory
**Usage**: Deletes an *empty* directory.

- **Unix**:
  `rmdir empty_directory`
- **Windows**:
  `rmdir empty_directory`

---

### 11. Recursively Delete a Directory
**Usage**: Deletes a directory and its contents recursively, since we cannot simply remove a directory that it not empty.

- **Unix**:
  `rm -r directory_name`
- **Windows**:
  `rmdir /S directory_name`

---

## Additional Notes:
- **Unix vs. Windows**: While most commands are similar, Windows uses different syntax for some tasks (e.g., `del`, `dir`, `cd`).
- **Admin Privileges**: Some commands (like removing system files) may require admin privileges. Use `sudo` in Unix to run commands as root: 
  `sudo command`
- **File Paths**: Use `/` for Unix systems and `\` for Windows file paths.

## CHEET SHEET

We have used all the commands necessary for this lab. You should try and practice using the command line as much as possible on your computer rather than using the window system. The more you practice the better you will be.

| **Function**                    | **Linux Command**      | **Windows Command**          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|

# Terminal Commands Practice Activities

## Activity 1: Directory Navigation
1. Open the terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).
2. Print the current working directory.
3. Create a new directory called `training`.
4. Change into the `training` directory.
5. Move back to the previous directory (the one above `training`).

## Activity 2: File Management
1. Inside the `training` directory, create two files named `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`.
2. List the contents of the `training` directory to confirm the files were created.
3. Delete `file1.txt`.
4. Modify `file2.txt` using `nano` or `notepad`. Add the following sentence "I am highly skilled in using the terminal."
5. View the contents of `file2.txt` to confirm the text was added.
   - **Linux**: Use `cat file2.txt`
   - **Windows**: Use `type file2.txt`

## Activity 3: Using Flags with Commands
1. Create three more files: `hidden.txt`, `notes.txt`, and `data.csv`.
2. List all files, including hidden files (if applicable).
3. List the details of all files in the directory.


## Activity 4: Creating and Removing Directories
1. Create a new directory called `projects`.`
2. Change into the `projects` directory.
3. Create a new directory called `2024`.
4. Navigate back to the `projects` directory and remove the `2024` directory.


## Activity 5: Recursive Deletion
1. Inside the `projects` directory, create a directory called `old_projects`.
2. Change into the `old_projects` directory and create two files: `draft.txt` and `archive.zip`.
3. Go back to the `projects` directory and remove the `old_projects` directory and all of its contents.
