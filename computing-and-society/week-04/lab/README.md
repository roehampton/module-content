# Computing and society week 4
## Discount usability test: Think aloud test


### Groups

You will be in groups of minimum 2.  Each person takes a role as follows:

1. Person taking the test (tester)
2. Person running the test (test organiser)
3. Notetakers (can be 2 people)

### Devising the test

**It is suggested that you use at least one of our examples below (Zipcar or ACM digital library) for your first test. Then you can go to 'running the test' immediately.**

If you want to use your own example for following 'rounds', you will need to follow these steps:
1. Choose a website. Ideally, the person taking the test will not be very familiar with it.
2. Without the tester present, the person running the test and observer should decide on 2 - 3  task that the person doing the test should aim to complete (or use one of our suggestions)


### Running the Test

1. Invite the person taking the test back to your 'room'
2. Introduce yourself and the observer.
3. Introduce the objectives of the test.
4. Reassure the tester that you are testing the site, not them!
5. Tell the tester your objectives and how any data will be used.
6. Explain to the tester how to 'think aloud'
7. Put your tester at ease by asking them some questions about themselves.
8. Test organiser should present the page to the tester and ask them to summarise what they see on the page, what they think the site is for, and what things can they do on this site.
9. The test organiser should explain the first task to the tester.
10. Tester should go ahead and try to fulfill the task, while thinking aloud. The test organiser may prompt the user to remind them of the task if necessary, and keep them talking but should not ask leading questions or help the tester.  The notetaker should keep a record of key points.
11. Repeat for each task.
12. Ask the user if they have any questions for you.



### Making recommendationst started

1. Among all the 3 people in the group, agree on the top 3 - 5 biggest problems encountered. Don't at this point recommend a fix.
2. Once the problems have been identified, make recommendations for simple changes that could address these problems.  Find the simplist solution you can eg. changes in wording.





## Example sites/tasks

### ACM digital library
[https://dl.acm.org][5137c379]

Task 1: Log in using your Roehampton account

Task 2: Find the full version of this article: 'Does Facebook use Sensitive Data for Advertising purposes' from the Communcations of the ACM magazine.

### Zipcar

[zipcar.co.uk][827a13c8]

Task 1: What documentation do I need to join zipcar?

Task 2: I'm thinking of joining zipcar so I can do a large shopping trip once per fortnight and drive to a friends house with my family - 1 hour drive away -  on a Sunday once per month.  I usually stay at my friends house for 3 - 4 hours.  What will this cost?

Task 3: I need a 7 seat car for my family. Will zipcar meet my need?
